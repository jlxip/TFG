 This book provides the foundation for understanding the theory and pracitce of compilers. Revised and updated, it reflects the current state of compilation.  Every chapter has been completely revised to reflect developments in software engineering, programming languages, and computer architecture that have occurred since 1986, when the last edition published.  The authors, recognizing that few readers will ever go on to construct a compiler, retain their focus on the broader set of problems faced in software design and software development.  Computer scientists, developers, and aspiring students that want to learn how to build, maintain, and execute a compiler for a major programming language.

In our evaluation we use combined system and user memory reference traces of thirteen industry-standard workloads. We show that the microkernel-based system executes substantially more non-idle system instructions for an equivalent workload than the monolithic system. Furthermore, the average instruction for programs running on Mach has a higher cost, in terms of memory cycles per instruction, than on Ultrix. In the context of our traces, we explore a number of popular assertions about the memory system behavior of modern operating systems, paying special attention to the effect that Mach's microkernel architecture has on system performance. Our results indicate that many, but not all of the assertions are true, and that a few, while true, have only negligible impact on real system performance.},

  abstract  = {Inter-process communication (ipc) has to be fast and effective, otherwise programmers will not use remote procedure calls (RPC), multithreading and multitasking adequately. Thus ipc performance is vital for modern operating systems, especially μ-kernel based ones. Surprisingly, most μ-kernels exhibit poor ipc performance, typically requiring 100 μs for a short message transfer on a modern processor, running with 50 MHz clock rate.In contrast, we achieve 5 μs; a twentyfold improvement.This paper describes the methods and principles used, starting from the architectural design and going down to the coding level. There is no single trick to obtaining this high performance; rather, a synergetic approach in design and implementation on all levels is needed. The methods and their synergy are illustrated by applying them to a concrete example, the L3 μ-kernel (an industrial-quality operating system in daily use at several hundred sites). The main ideas are to guide the complete kernel design by the ipc requirements, and to make heavy use of the concept of virtual address space inside the μ-kernel itself.As the L3 experiment shows, significant performance gains are possible: compared with Mach, they range from a factor of 22 (8-byte messages) to 3 (4-Kbyte messages). Although hardware specific details influence both the design and implementation, these techniques are applicable to the whole class of conventional general purpose von Neumann processors supporting virtual addresses. Furthermore, the effort required is reasonably small, for example the dedicated parts of the μ-kernel can be concentrated in a single medium sized module.},

We assume correctness of compiler, assembly code, and hardware, and we used a unique design approach that fuses formal and operating systems techniques. To our knowledge, this is the first formal proof of functional correctness of a complete, general-purpose operating-system kernel. Functional correctness means here that the implementation always strictly follows our high-level abstract specification of kernel behaviour. This encompasses traditional design and implementation safety properties such as the kernel will never crash, and it will never perform an unsafe operation. It also proves much more: we can predict precisely how the kernel will behave in every possible situation.seL4, a third-generation microkernel of L4 provenance, comprises 8,700 lines of C code and 600 lines of assembler. Its performance is comparable to other high-performance L4 kernels.},
